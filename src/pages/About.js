                  <p>
                    I am a lifelong learner and always looking to expand my
                    knowledge and skill set. I decided to become a coding
                    bootcamp student to learn full-stack development. Even if
                    Iâ€™m not the one doing development work, understanding the
                    front end, back end, web and software development process,
                    and developing well-rounded knowledge of data structures,
                    will greatly enrichen the ability with which I can
                    efficiently work with vendors, developers, and other
                    stakeholders to drive a project or process to the best
                    possible solutions.
